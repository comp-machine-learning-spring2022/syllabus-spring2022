# Welcome to CSC 294

I am so excited that you'll be joining this educational journey through 
the computational aspects of machine learning! You are now, just by being here, a machine learning explorer and practitioner. This course will 
help us frame out exactly what that means and also what _machine learning_ is.

## Official Course Description

An introduction to machine learning from a programming perspective. Students will develop an understanding of the basic machine learning concepts (including underfitting/overfitting, measures of model complexity, training/test set splitting, and cross-validation), but with an explicit focus on machine learning systems design (including evaluating algorithmic complexity and development of programming architecture) and on machine learning at scale. Principles of supervised and unsupervised learning will be demonstrated via an array of machine learning methods including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, ensemble methods, and neural networks/deep learning as well as dimension reduction, clustering and recommender systems. Students will implement classic machine learning techniques, including gradient descent. 

#### Motivating Questions

There are a few questions motivating our course work: 
- What is Machine Learning?   
- What role does computer science play in machine learning?  
- What habits of mind do we need to develop to become machine learning practitioners?   


#### Course Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to...
1. Detail differences between supervised and unsupervised learning tasks and methods, as well as discuss the issues when dealing with large scale data    
2. Implement a variety of machine learning algorithms in python and assess their efficacy   
3. Compare models, and assess the efficacy of machine learning algorithms and results using evaluation metrics and in terms of the context of the data's domain    
4. Develop an appreciation for ethical implications of machine learning algorithms   
5. Work iteratively and reflectively to apply machine learning techniques to a data set of interest with informative documentation, written for a variety of audiences 


## Syllabus 

This webpage and the associated links together function as the syllabus. 
Everything that you need to know about the course is either here or linked from here. 

The course syllabus is the most important document underlying the culture of 
our course and our classroom. I view my syllabus as a sacred document that 
both introduces and governs the course. In taking this view, I work to detail 
as much about the course as possible from the big picture ideas to the minute 
details of course policies. I believe that the first activity a student should 
do when beginning a course is to carefully read and examine the syllabus. In 
keeping with that belief, there are a few tasks in this document that will 
help us build our course community.

Please read the syllabus this week and complete these tasks to help shape our community. If you have questions about the syllabus, please ask them!
