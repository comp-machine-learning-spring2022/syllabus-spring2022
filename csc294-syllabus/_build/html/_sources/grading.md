# Assessment

Just like beginning a project, we begin this course with nothing completed yet; similarly, we begin the semester with no points, just yet. As assignments are assigned and returned we will slowly build points towards the 1000 possible points. In keeping with this philosophy, each assignment adds to your total score. In more traditional courses, one might begin with 100% and have their grade slowly chipped down to a final score. Instead in this course, we are building our grades up in concert with our knowledge about machine learning. View each assignment as a reflection of the depth of your machine learning knowledge base. 

There are four parts of your grade: 1) labs, 2) homework, 3) projects, and 4) course engagement. The 1000 possible points for the course are distributed as follows:   
- **Labs - 240 points:** Each lab is worth 12 points and there are 25 labs for a total of 300 possible points.    
- **Homework - 260 points:** Each homework is worth 52 points and there are 6 homework assignments for a total of 312 possible points.    
- **Projects - 300 points:** Each project is worth 100 points and there are 4 projects for a total of 400 possible points.    
- **Course Engagement - 200 points:** This part of your grade with student input. After your mid-semester conference, you will reflect on your engagement with the course so far and make a plan for the remainder of the semester. That plan is what you will then use to assign yourself a grade for the course engagement part of your grade.

For the lab, homework, and project parts of your grade, there are many more possible points than what the final grade computation uses

## Grading Practicalities: There will be three kinds of grading for this course: 1) rubrics (supported by the checkpoint system), 2) on completion, and 3) with student input. 

1. Homework assignments and projects will be graded under typical rubric grading. Depending on the assignment, detailed rubrics may be issued before the assignment is submitted, while in other cases only general outlines will be given in advance of the assignment. 
2. Labs will be graded on completion. Note that completion here means that the work was completed in good faith. The act of turning in something does not guarantee a score of completion. But any work that is clearly done in good faith will be marked as complete and will earn full marks.
3. The class engagement part of the course will be graded with student input. 




## Letter grades: 

Traditional letter grades will be assigned using the below listed minimum medal levels:

| Letter Grade    | Number of points |
| :----:       |    :----:   |
| A     | 950 - 1000 pts |
| A-    | 900 - 949 pts  |
| B     | 800 - 899 pts  |
| C     | 700 - 799 pts  |
| D     | 600 - 699 pts  |


At the instructorâ€™s discretion, these grade cutoffs may be lowered at the end of the semester, but they will never be raised. Cut-offs not stated here for the pluses and minuses will be determined at the end of the semester.
