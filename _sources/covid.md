# Learning in a Pandemic

## Attending class

We are still in the midst of a global pandemic. In keeping with the 
[Guidelines](https://www.smith.edu/covid19/guidelines-policies) laid out in 
Smith's Culture of Care, if you are ill and/or have _any_ COVID symptoms, 
please do **not** come to _in-person_ class. Instead, please log in on zoom. 
The link can be found on our Moodle site and our slack space. 

You do not need to email me to ask permission to come to class on gather or in person. However, if you are not able to be in-person for 3 consecutive meetings, then we need to check in. 

Similarly, do not come to student hours nor appointments if you are ill and/or have _any_ COVID symptoms. Please use the gather to attend student hours virtually, and a zoom link can be provided for any in-person appointment.  

:::{warning}
Do **NOT** come to in-person class or student hours, if you are ill and/or have any COVID symptoms. 
:::

Failure to respect this policy will result in an email to both the class dean and your advisor. 


## What if we have to pivot to online? 

The course should be able to remain largely remain unchanged. The structure of this course is similar to one that I used in Spring 2021 for _Computational Machine Learning._ That course was fully online, and students had positive comments on this format. 

## Flexibility in grading structure

There are four parts of your grade: 1) labs, 2) homework, 3) projects, and 4) course engagement. The 1000 possible points for the course are distributed as follows:   
- **Labs - 240 points:** Each lab is worth 12 points and there are 25 labs for a total of 300 possible points.    
- **Homework - 260 points:** Each homework is worth 52 points and there are 6 homework assignments for a total of 312 possible points.    
- **Projects - 300 points:** Each project is worth 100 points and there are 4 projects for a total of 400 possible points.    
- **Course Engagement - 200 points:** This part of your grade with student input. After your mid-semester conference, you will reflect on your engagement with the course so far and make a plan for the remainder of the semester. That plan is what you will then use to assign yourself a grade for the course engagement part of your grade.

For the lab, homework, and project parts of your grade, there are many more possible points than what the final grade computation uses

### Translating to the "real world"

These systems attempt to match my experience of being in the “real world.” Assignments under the first system (ie. labs, homework assignments, and projects), you need to do about 80% of them well to get full credit for 100% in that portion of the grade. This matches my daily life where I can physically get to about 80% of my to-do list. Under the second system, it is often easier to edit a draft than to start from a blank page, and having small deadlines (where the reward is quick feedback) gives structure to larger projects. 

While I do believe that each assignment for this course is important, I also believe that the college structure does not always allow you to practice “real world” decisions such as balancing your health with your work. So while I will not tell you to hand in an assignment or to not hand one in, I would love to listen to you practicing making these decisions. 



## Latework

Instead of firm deadlines throughout the semester, we will be using "best by dates." These best by dates are my recommendation of when you should aim to complete work to continue making progress in the course. If you work best with firm deadlines, then you can treat these best by dates as due dates. 

All of these best by dates are listed on the [Detailed Course Schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zppEXeUKFf764wLZJabBfvyTF5gR-3AjwREnvRz_BQ/edit?usp=sharing). This is a great moment to note these dates your system for keeping track of your work (ie. planner, calendar, etc). (If you want to really stretch here, do this for all major assignments in all your courses.) 

In general, later course content builds on previous content, and if one is spending lots of time on an assignment (and thus is well past the recommended "best by" date), then there is less time for the next assignment. If you find yourself routinely working on assignments well past their best by dates, let's check in. 

The only two firm deadlines of the course are the last day of classes and the last day of finals:    
 - **Due on the Last day of classes** -- All labs, all homework assignments, and the first two projects
 - **Due on the last day of finals** -- The last two projects and your engagement journal

There are no extensions to these two deadlines without intervention from a class dean.
